Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

Answerï¼š

function sumFibs(num) {
  let sum = 0;
  function fibs(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    return fibs(n - 2) + fibs(n - 1);
  }

  for (let i = 0; fibs(i) <= num; i++) {
    if (fibs(i) % 2 === 1) {
      sum += fibs(i);
    }
  }

  return sum;
}

sumFibs(4);
