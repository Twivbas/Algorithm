JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects: Caesars Cipher
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

Answer：

function rot13(str) {
  let arr = str.split('');
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (str.charCodeAt(i) >= 65 && str.charCodeAt(i) <= 78) {
      arr[i] = String.fromCharCode(str.charCodeAt(i) + 13);
    }
    if (str.charCodeAt(i) >= 78 && str.charCodeAt(i) <= 90) {
      arr[i] = String.fromCharCode(str.charCodeAt(i) - 13) 
    }
  }
  str = arr.join(''); 
  //console.log(str);
  return str;
}

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");
