Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Primes
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.

Answer：

function sumPrimes(num) {
  let sum = 0;
  //判断一个数是不是素数
  function primes(a) {
    if (a < 2) return false;
    for (let i = 2; i < a; i++) {
      if (a % i == 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
  for (let j = 1; j <= num; j++) {
    if(primes(j)) {
      sum += (j);
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

sumPrimes(10);
